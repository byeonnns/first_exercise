<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document management system[1] accessed over the Internet.[2] It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform.[3]
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. </p>

<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive
forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.
It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items, HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
